In order to build a high-quality knowledge base, it's important that we ensure each unique question exists on Quora only once. Writers shouldn't have to write the same answer to multiple versions of the same question, and readers should be able to find a single canonical page with the question they're looking for. For example, we'd consider questions like “What are the best ways to lose weight?”, “How can a person reduce weight?”, and “What are effective weight loss plans?” to be duplicate questions because they all have the same intent. To prevent duplicate questions from existing on Quora, we've developed machine learning and natural language processing systems to automatically identify when questions with the same intent have been asked multiple times.
 
We recently released a public dataset of duplicate questions that can be used to train duplicate question detection models like the one we use at Quora. In this post, we'll give you a sense of what's possible with our duplicate question dataset by outlining a few deep learning explorations we pursued in a recent hack week. 
 
We're also excited to announce a meetup event for NLP and Machine Learning enthusiasts that we'll be hosting at the Quora office in Mountain View, CA on the evening of February 27. We have a couple of exciting speakers lined up: Ben Hamner, co-founder and CTO of Kaggle will talk about “Kaggle Competitions and Reproducible Machine Learning”, and Xavier Amatriain, VP of Engineering at Quora, will be giving a talk entitled “Machine Learning and NLP at Quora”.
